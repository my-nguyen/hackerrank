Consider an array of n integers, A = [a0,a1,...,an-1], where all but one of the
integers occur in pairs. In other words, every element in A occurs exactly twice
except for one unique element.

Given A, find and print the unique element.

Input Format
* The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of integers
  in the array.
* The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective
  values in A.

Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 100
* It is guaranteed that n is an odd number.
* 0 <= ai <= 100, where 0 <= i < n.

Output Format
Print the unique number that occurs only once in A on a new line.

Sample Input 0
1
1

Sample Output 0
1

Explanation 0
The array only contains a single 1, so we print 1 as our answer.

Sample Input 1
3
1 1 2

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
We have two 1's and one 2. We print 2, because that's the only unique element in
the array.

Sample Input 2
5
0 0 1 2 1

Sample Output 2
2

Explanation 2
We have two 0's, two 1's, and one 2. We print 2, because that's the only unique
element in the array.
