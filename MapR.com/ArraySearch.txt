Write a function that searches a sorted array of integers (in increasing order)
and returns the first index that most closely matches a given criteria of
operator and value. If no entry matches the search criteria, return -1.

arraySearch(int[1, 2, 3,], LESS_THAN, 2) -> 0
arraySearch(int[1, 2, 4, 5], GREATER_THAN, 3) -> 2

Do pay close attention to simplicity, code readability and performance.
