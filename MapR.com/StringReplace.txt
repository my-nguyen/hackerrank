Write a function that takes 3 arguments. The first is a data string, the second
is a matach string and the third is a replacement string. All occurrences of the
'match' in the 'source' should be replaced by the 'replace'. Return the new
string.

Ex. stringReplace("test123", "123", "456") -> "test456"

DO NOT use any standard language built-in String replace() function for this.
Any other language constructs are permitted.

DO pay close attention to simplicity, code readability and performance.
