Anna loves studying trees (i.e., undirected acyclic connected graphs). She even invented the following algorithm to randomly generate a tree with vertices:

    Initially, we have a positive integer, , and a tree with one vertex (numbered ).
    Next, we add vertices one at a time. To add each vertex (where ), we create edge where is randomly chosen from the previously-added vertices (i.e., vertices in the inclusive range from to ).

We define a leaf to be a vertex whose degree (i.e., number of connected edges) is exactly . Note that vertex is considered to be the root, so it's never counted as a leaf.

Given the number of vertices in the tree, help Anna by finding the expected number, , of leaves in the tree. Then print the value of as your answer.

Given , we can generate two possible trees with Anna's algorithm:

The first tree only has one leaf (), and the second one has two leaves ( and ). This gives us an expected value of , so we print the value of as our answer.

Note: Recall that vertex is the root and never counts as a leaf.
