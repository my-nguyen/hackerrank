Let f(P) denote the number of inversions in some permutation, P. Calculate the
number of permutations satisfying the following conditions:
1. P is a permutation of { 1, 2, ..., n }.
2. f(P) = k

Given n and k, find and print the number of permutations of { 1, 2, ..., n }
having k inversions. As this value can be quite large, your answer must be
modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input Format
A single line of two space-separated integers describing the respective values
of n and k.

Constraints
For 100% of the test cases:
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 0 <= k <= min(C2-n, 10^5)
For 50% of the test cases:
* 1 <= n <= 1000
* 0 <= k <= 1000

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the number of permutations having k inversions,
modulo 10^9 + 7.

Sample Input
3 2

Sample Output
2

Explanation

Because n=3, our initial sequence is { 1, 2, 3 } and we must find the number of
permutations having k=2 inversions. There are two such permutations:
1. { 3, 1, 2 } has two inversions, (3, 1) and (3, 2).
2. { 2, 3, 1 } has two inversions, (2, 1) and (3, 1).

Thus, we print 2 as our answer.
