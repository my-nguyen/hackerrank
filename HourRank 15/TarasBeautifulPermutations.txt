Tara has an array, , consisting of integers where each integer occurs at most times in the array.

Let's define to be a permutation of where is the element of permutation . Tara thinks a permutation is beautiful if there is no index such that where .

You are given queries where each query consists of some array . For each , help Tara count the number of possible beautiful permutations of the integers in and print the count, modulo , on a new line.

Note: Two permutations, and , are considered to be different if and only if there exists an index such that and .

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of queries. The subsequent lines describe each query in the following form:

    The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in array .
    The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective values of in array .

Constraints

    Each integer in can occur at most times.

For of the maximum score:

    The sum of over all queries does not exceed .

For of the maximum score:

Output Format

For each query, print the the number of possible beautiful permutations, modulo , on a new line.

We perform the following queries:

    Array and there is only one good permutation:
    image
    Thus, we print the result of on a new line.

    Array and there are two good permutations:
    image
    Thus, we print the result of on a new line.

    Array and there are two good permutations:
    image
    For demonstration purposes, the following two permutations are invalid (i.e., not good):
    image
    Because we only want the number of good permutations, we print the result of
