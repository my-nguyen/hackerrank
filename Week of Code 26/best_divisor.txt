Kristen loves playing with and comparing numbers. She thinks that if she takes
two different positive numbers, the one whose digits sum to a larger number is
better than the other. If the sum of digits is equal for both numbers, then she
thinks the smaller number is better. For example, Kristen thinks that 13 is
better than 31 and that 12 is better than 11.

Given an integer, n, can you find the divisor of n that Kristin will consider to
be the best?

Input Format
A single integer denoting n.

Constraints
0 <= n <= 10^5

Output Format
Print an integer denoting the best divisor of n.

Sample Input 0
12

Sample Output 0
6

Explanation 0
The set of divisors of 12 can be expressed as { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 }. The divisor
whose digits sum to the largest number is 6 (which, having only one digit, sums
to itself). Thus, we print 6 as our answer.
