There is a big music festival happening on Main street in Bytetown! We can
consider this street to be along an infinite number line where, at every point
on the line, some genre of music playing. More precisely, there are n points,
a0,a1,...,an-1, which are borders between different genres of music. So, at
every point from -inf to a0, the first genre of music is playing (say, Techno).
At every point from a0 to a1, the second genre of music is playing (say, Disco).
This continues until the last genre of music (say, House), which is playing from
an-1 to +inf. All coordinates are given in miles.

Conor wants to visit this event. He plans to walk exactly m miles at a constant
speed of 1 mile per hour in the positive direction. For each genre of music he
passes, he wants to listen to it for a minimum of hmin hours (to determine
whether he likes it or not) and a a maximum of hmax hours (so he will not get
bored).

Given n integers denoting the respective border points for each music genre and
the values of m, hmin and hmax, find and print an integer denoting the optimal
location for Conor to start his walk through the festival such that all of his
above requirements are satisfied.

Input Format
* The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of border
  points.
* The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers describing the
  respective values of a0,a1,...an-1.
* The third line contains three space-separated integers describing the
  respective values of m, hmin, and hmax.

Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 10^6
* |ai|<= 10^9, all ai are pairwise different and given in increasing order.
* 1 <= h1 <= h2 <= 10^9
* 1 <= m <= 10^9
* It's guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the possible start point for Conor's walk. If
there are several solutions, print any one of them.

Sample Input 0
2
1 3
7 2 3

Sample Output 0
-2

Explanation 0
If Conor starts at point -2, he will hear music in segment [-2, 1] for 3 hours,
segment [1, 3] for 2 hours, and segment [3, 5] for his last 2 hours. Similarly,
he could start walking at -1 and still satisfy all of his conditions.
