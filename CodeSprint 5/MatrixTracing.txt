A word from the English dictionary is taken and arranged as a matrix. e.g.
"MATHEMATICS"

MATHE
ATHEM
THEMA
HEMAT
EMATI
MATIC
ATICS

There are many ways to trace this matrix in a way that helps you construct this
word. You start tracing the matrix from the top-left position and at each
iteration, you either move RIGHT or DOWN, and ultimately reach the bottom-right
of the matrix. It is assured that any such tracing generates the same word. How
many such tracings can be possible for a given word of length m+n-1 written as a
matrix of size m * n?

Input Format
* The first line of input contains an integer T. T test cases follow.
* Each test case contains 2 space separated integers m & n (in a new line)
  indicating that the matrix has m rows and each row has n characters.

Constraints
* 1 <= T <= 103
* 1 ≤ m,n ≤ 106

Output Format
Print the number of ways (S) the word can be traced as explained in the problem
statement. If the number is larger than 109+7, print S mod (10^9 + 7) for each
testcase (in a new line).

Sample Input
1
2 3

Sample Output
3

Explanation
Let's consider a word AWAY written as the matrix
AWA
WAY

Here, the word AWAY can be traced in 3 different ways, traversing either RIGHT or DOWN.
AWA
  Y

AW
 AY

A
WAY

Hence the answer is 3.
