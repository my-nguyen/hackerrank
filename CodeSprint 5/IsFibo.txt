You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of
the Fibonacci sequence.

The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. A
Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two
elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.

Formally:
* fib0 = 0
* fib1 = 1
  .
  .
  .
* fibn = fibn-1 + fibn-2

Input Format
* The first line contains T, number of test cases.
* T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N.

Output Format
Display IsFibo if is a Fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not. The output
for each test case should be displayed in a new line.

Constraints
* 1 <= T <= 10^5
* 1 <= N <= 10^10

Sample Input
3
5
7
8

Sample Output
IsFibo
IsNotFibo
IsFibo

Explanation
5 is a Fibonacci number given by fib5 = 3 + 2
7 is not a Fibonacci number
8 is a Fibonacci number given by fib6 = 5 + 3
